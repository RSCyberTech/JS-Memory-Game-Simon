JAVASCRIPT MEMORY GAME

This project was done as a way to improve and train my javascript knowledge.
The objective is to create a memory game in javascript in which the user plays again the computer.
The user has to memorize the color sequence outputed by the computer, and then insert the same sequence through the buttons.

UX

Regarding the UX, the idea was to do something simple and straight forward.
Something the user could understand what it is, and how it is done, in the first few second after landing at the website.
Neutral colors were used, in order to the user to focus directly in the colored buttons, to play.

FEATURES

The website has 7 buttons:
    
    - RESET BEST SCORE button: at any time this button can be pressed in order to reset the best score;
    - START BUTTON: this button must be used to start the game or after landing at the webpage, or after losing an attempt.
    - 4 COLORED BUTTONS (blue, green, red, yellow): these buttons are used in two ways. for the user to play, and for the computer to output colors.
                                                    each time one of the buttons is active, its color changes.
                
The website also has two areas that are updated after each round.
One of the areas shows the current round, so the player can know how far he/she is from winning.
The other area shows the best score until this moment since the page was loaded or since the RESET BEST SCORE button was pressed.

TECHNOLOGIES

This website uses HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
This website also uses BOOTSTRAP.

TESTING

This website was tested in Google Chrome at first.
After being finished was also tested in multiple devices by multiple people.
In order to ensure the website was understandable and well deployed I have asked to some people to test it.
I also asked them to play the game.
The results were all positive.
The test were done in both DESKTOP and MOBILE environments.

DEPLOYMENT

This website was deployed directly from its GitHub repository, using GitHub Pages.
